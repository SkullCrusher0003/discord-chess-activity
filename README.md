# Discord Activity - Chess In The Park
Discord has been launching Games in VC one by one. *Chess in the Park is an exclusive game which is still in alpha testing and only available to discord.gg/discordgameslab.* However, with over 10 games going on at once in one server, it causes extreme lag. **This code brings this game to any server.**

You need to startup the bot to be able to play this game in your server.

### Bot Startup Instructions for Beginners
1. Go to discord.com/developers, create an application.
2. Open IDLE on your PC, copy main.py.
3. Replace "TOKEN_HERE" with your bot token, which you will find in your application details.
4. Run the Code.

### Usage
- Run `!!play [activity]` after joining a voice channel.
- Click on the link sent by the bot to start playing!

### Adctivites
- Currently supports 5 activities.
  - chess (Chess in The Park)
  - fish (Fishington.io)
  - poker (Poker Night)
  - yt (Youtube Together)
  - betrayal (Betrayal.io)
- Run `!!play [activity]` after joining a voice channel.

### Example Usage
- Run `!!play chess` after joining a voice channel.
- Click on the link sent by the bot to start playing!


### Errors
- discord.gg/0 - This means the bot doesn't have access to the voice channel you're in, or cannot view it.
- discord.gg/50013 - This means the bot doesn't have `create_invite` permission in your voice channel.

### SideNotes
- This project is in no way affiliated with Discord or it's games.
- If discord patches up their AppID for this game, the project/bot will seize to work.
