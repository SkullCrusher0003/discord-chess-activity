# Discord Activity - Chess In The Park
Discord has been launching Games in VC one by one. *Chess in the Park is an exclusive game which is still in alpha testing and only available to discord.gg/discordgameslab.* However, with over 10 games going on at once in one server, it causes extreme lag. **This code brings this game to any server.**

You need to startup the bot to be able to play this game in your server.

### Bot Startup Instructions for Beginners
Go to discord.com/developers, create an application.
Open IDLE on your PC, copy main.py.
Replace "TOKEN_HERE" with your bot token, which you will find in your application details.
Run the Code.
